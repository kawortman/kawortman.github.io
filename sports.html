	<h4>First off, my favorite sport to play: <i>football</i>. In high school, I played cornerback and wide receiver for my school: John Jay, Cross River. My two years on varsity, we went to the seciton quarterfinals then the semifinals. Football taught me many invaluable lessons and caused me to form many meaningful friendships. I had a blast during my years playing football and extremely thankful for it.

	<h4>Secondly, my favorite sport to watch is also football. I love sitting down on Sundays with my family and watching the games. I always set aside my Sundays to sit on the couch and watch NFL Redzone for hours. I am a massive Jets and Bengals fan.

	<h4>Finally, my favorite team in all of sports is the New York Knicks. Throughout my childhood, the Knicks were astronomically terrible. Barely making any playoff runs, it was tough to be a fan. But, as of recent, the Knicks - led by Jalen Brunson - have shown light and are currently fifth in their conference standings. I am excited to watch them on their playoff run this year.
