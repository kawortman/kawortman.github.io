	<h3><strong>Interstellar</strong></h3>
	<p>
		"Interstellar" is definitely my <strong>favorite movie</strong>. I love how it blends crazy space stuff with really touching moments. Watching them navigate through space to save Earth, while also dealing with all this time twisty stuff, is just mind-blowing. It's not just the science fiction that gets me; it's how the movie digs into what it means to be human. And the soundtrack? Amazing. It's one of those movies that sticks with you long after you've seen it.

	<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
	My <strong>favorite thriller movie</strong> is certainly Inception. It is directed by Christopher Nolan, so that speaks for itself. This film is an absolute mind-boggling adventure. I needed to watch it at least twice to grasp about 50% of what happened. It is a journey through dreams that blurs the lines between reality and imagination. The intricate plot, layered storytelling, and stunning visuals make 'Inception' a captivating experience that keeps you thinking long after the credits roll.
