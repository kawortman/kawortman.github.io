        My first hobby is golf! I am a really big golfer even though I just started this summer. I love going out during a nice summer day and playing 18 holes with my friends back in New York. My favorite course is called <a href="https://www.centennialgolf.com/">Centennial in Carmel, New York</a> and my favorite club is the 7 iron!

    <p>Another one of my hobbies is cooking. I am extremely interested in the art of cuisine. My favorite dish to make is <i>penne alla vodka</i> because I feel it is my best. My sister is a baker, so we make a good combo for dinner and dessert!</p>

        <p>My third hobby is playing sports. I love football, basketball, tennis, and as mentioned, golf. I love being outside and playing with my friends. It is always a great exercise and a fun time.</p>
